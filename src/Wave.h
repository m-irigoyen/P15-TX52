/*
	Waves are the class representing a spike of a wave.
	Each wave object represents one spike of an emitted wave.
	Each wave carries information about its amplitude : the amplitude of the spike. When receptors recieve a wave, they will remember the time they received the wave, and compute the frequency themselves by comparing the time of the next spike they receive.
	So the wave does not carry information about its frequency.
